## Campus Rotaract Club of Davis Slack Group

### General Info

Slack is a group communication tool, that a lot of tech companies utilize and tout. Its goal is to streamline the communication process into one central location so that communication is improved, and it allows teams to focus on things other than making sure messages are relayed properly.

Slack has free apps for

* your browser
* OS X (apparently this sucks so just use the browser version)
* iOS and Android

The CRCD board has two main goals in using Slack:

* Improve communication and knowledge sharing between director pairs
* Make things we've posted in the past more easily searchable and cross-referenceable

Slack is pretty self-explanatory and easy to use, but this writeup is so that

* People who aren't good with computers can see and make use of a majority of Slack's cool features
* Directors in future years can quickly learn the ropes without struggling with the platform

### Using Slack

Following are some screenshots of various views you can get to in Slack.

[**Group Chat View**](http://i.imgur.com/ovAnDrS.jpg) - This is the default view when you sign into your team.

1. **Team Name** - Clicking the "v" arrow allows you to do a variety of things including 
    * Configuring team settings (Admins only)
    * Changing teams
    * Sign out
2. **Channel List** - A list of all channels within a team that you can see (obviously private channels that you're not a member of will not be visible to you)
3. **User Settings** - Clicking the "^" arrow allows you to do a variety of things including
    * Configure your user settings & preferences
    * Change your profile pic
    * Sign out
4. **Channel Title** - Name of the channel (duh), click the gold star to favorite a channel if it's one that you use a lot!
5. **File Upload** - Rather self explanatory
6. **Awesome Buttons** - Their functions from left to right
    * **Question** - Opens up Slack's help center if you're having trouble
    * **3 Item List** - Opens up quick access to starred items, @ mentions, files, the team directory, and activity feed
    * **"Play" Button** - Opens up a detailed view of files shared within the team

1. **Your Account**
    * **Personal Settings** - Change username, password, email, time zone, account deletion

    * **Edit Profile** - Update personal info

    * **Access Logs** - Details of what devices *your* account has been logged onto from. Useful to check if your account was hacked by somebody else
2. **Your Team**
    * **Statistics** - Usage stats about your team
    * **Custom Emoji** - Add custom faces and what not if the defaults aren't expressive enough for you
    * **Slackbot Responses** - Create responses with Slackbot, haven't looked into this very much
    * **Loading Messages** - Display fun messages when Slack is loading
    * **Gateways** - Set up Slack for use with IRC and XMPP. I don't think we'll ever need this
    * **Team Access Logs** - Tells you who signed up with what device at what time

    * **Settings** - Configure default channels, username display, message editing, integrations, stats, who can add emoji, loading messages, and slackbot responses, and information protection
    * **Team Members** - Shows a list of all current team members. Make people admins, remove accounts, and make accounts ["restricted"](http://i.imgur.com/EQwCGnR.png)
    * **Invitations** - Invite people to your team, or send them the invite link so they can add themselves
    * **Attachments** - Haven't seen enough about this yet. Will add more in the future.
    
### Notifications

Getting a notification for every single message that is sent will quickly get very annoying. Here are the [settings that I personally recommend](http://i.imgur.com/cv1MubJ.png):

* **Desktop Notifications:** "Activity of any kind" or "Only Direct Messages & Highlight Words"
* **Mobile Push Notifications:** "Only Direct Messages & Highlight Words" or "Only Direct Messages"
* **Channel Specific Notifications:** "Everything" for the channel specific to your director position (Service is shown) and the channel titled "important"

These settings will ensure that you will always receive messages that deserve your immediate attention while ignoring messages you don't need to see right away.
